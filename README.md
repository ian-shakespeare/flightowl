## Description

The web app implementation of [FlightOwl](https://flightowl.app). Server management is handled in `*.server.ts`. All routes are server side rendered. Data is fetched from `flightowl-api`. Styling is done with TailwindCSS.

FlightOwl is the all-in-one web and mobile app for finding and saving flights. FlightOwl offers a simple interface for flight searching. Flights can be saved and updated, meaning the user can easily save flights if they aren't ready to purchase.
